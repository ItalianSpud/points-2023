# the-points-2023
A Starter Project with Points.
Contains two classes:
# Point
a class which contains an x value and a y value as data members. Also includes methods to compare two points, find angle between two points, and find if a set of three points form an inwards or outwards facing angle.
# PointList
Uses a dynamically allocated array to hold a set of pointers to point objects. Contains a convex hull method: this method finds the convex hull of our point list using a Graham Scan.
